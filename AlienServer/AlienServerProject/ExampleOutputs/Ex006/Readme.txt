Example taken after noticing, that there are NEGATIVE SLEEPTIMES in "ConsumedCoordinates.txt"!

This indicates some sort of error with variable processing, which could also explain the strange distance values.

The last assumption however was wrong, as the cause of the negative sleep values was the mathematical property of the logarithm function (think log(0.1)).
